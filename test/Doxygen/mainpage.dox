/// Overview

///
/// A quick and easy sequence of tests for the extensible unsigned integer
/// class `uintx_t`. These tests are not meant to be comprehensive. Rather,
/// they serve as minimal verification of the `uintx_t` implementation and
/// as examples of how to code with extensible unsigned integers. For a
/// list of the test performed, see main.cpp.
